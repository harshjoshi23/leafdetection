# leafdetection
This is the base model but there are many issues with it currently.
The DataSet is a custom data set so the model was trained on the leaf images instead of the whole plant.
Similarly the training file needs to be trained for more epochs and it's accuracy is going to improve in the coming time when the dataset is going to improve.
This is a binary classification model so it is going to tell if the object in the bounding box is leaf or not.
